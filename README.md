# Property-Website

This website was inspired by Zoopla and Rightmove. I created it with Django, HTML, CSS and bootstrap. 

I created this property website because I encountered problems with Zoopla and Rightmove,  such as sometimes getting listings of boats and garages when searching for flats and houses. Also there is no option to search for freehold properties exclusively.

So I created this website and solved the first of my problems, being only having houses and flats on this website.

<h2>Problems I need to address<h2>
Currently when I search for flat or house, both tyes of properties are displayed, so I need to make the search query allow two search paaremetrs and dispaly properties that meet both these parameters.

<h2>Future features<h2>
I intend to add an option to search for freehold and leasehold properties.
I also intend to add a contact form where potential clients can send a message to an estate agent to show their interest in a property.
